# Computational Physics Projects


This repository covers a wide range of fascinating topics at the intersection of physics and computation, Notably:

- **Fractal Generation** – algorithms to create beautiful fractal patterns such as julia set and koch fractal.
- **Deposition Models** – simulating surface growth methods such as ballistic deposition, needle growth and various other methods.
- **Random Walk** – developing codes for 1D and 2D random walk, diffusion limited aggregation and self-avoiding random walk.
- **Percolation Theory** – studying connectivity and critical phenomena in a lattice using coloring and Hoshen–Kopelman algorithm.
- **Random Number Generation** – implementing and testing RNG methods crucial for simulations.
- **Monte Carlo Methods** – tackling statistical physics problems through stochastic sampling and learning about Metroplis algorithm.
- **Ising Model** – Creating an Ising model and calculating energy, magnetization, heat capacity and phase changes in the system.
- **Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations** – solving IVP differential equations numerically.
- **Molecular Dynamics Simulations** – simulating a noble gas using newton laws and Lennard-Jones potential.
- **Schelling Segregation Model** – exploring dynamics of social segregation through agent-based modeling.
